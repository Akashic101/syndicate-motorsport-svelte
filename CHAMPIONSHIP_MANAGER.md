## Getting Championship ID

To get the Championship ID, you need to know the API endpoint. The ID is the part after `/championship/` in the URL:

```
http://138.201.226.34:8092/championship/YOUR_CHAMPIONSHIP_ID/standings.json
```

For example, if the URL is:

```
http://138.201.226.34:8092/championship/f1-2024-abc123/standings.json
```

Then the Championship ID is: `f1-2024-abc123`

# Optional but recommended apps

- [Blinker Sound App](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/blinker-sound-app.64886/)
- [Dashboard Indicators](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/dashboard-indicators.72636/)
- [CrewChief](https://thecrewchief.org/)

## Car skinpack

While optional we highly recommend download the custom liveries the community created for this event. This is the first event we are running a custom bot to make downloading and updating liveries, more details will follow when available. As a backup we will also provide a manual zip-file before each session

## Control Patch settings

### Required:

Hazard lights: Every car is equipped with hazard lights. If you crash and damage your suspension but can still slowly make it back to the pits, you are required to switch on your hazards. This alerts drivers behind you that your car is compromised and moving at a reduced pace.

High/low beam toggle: You need to be able to switch between high and low beams, as this greatly affects visibility during night driving. In most cases, CSP already enables _“Use high beams mode by default”_ under `Settings → CSP → Car Instruments → Input Options`. Having this control mapped to a keyboard key is sufficient, since you’ll rarely need to toggle it—if ever.

### Strongly recommended (but optional, depending on available buttons/keys):

Left & right turn signals: All cars have functional indicators, at least until lower level-of-detail models are used for distant vehicles. Please bind these controls so you can indicate which side of the track you’re staying on when being lapped.

Tip 1: The Blinker Sound App (linked above) provides an audible cue when your indicator is active.

Tip 2: The Dashboard Indicators App (also linked above) visually shows which indicator is on, useful for cars without built-in dashboard indicator lights.

## Real Penalty Setup

Real Penalty is included in the mandatory downloads listed at the top and must be installed and enabled. It is required for driver swaps and verifies that the app is running on your client. If Real Penalty is missing—or if you are not using CSP v0.2.11 or newer—the server will automatically remove you.

To ensure a proper installation, Real Penalty must be installed manually. _Do not install it through Content Manager._

Once the app is installed, activate it in Content Manager by going to `Settings → Assetto Corsa → Python Apps` and enabling Real Penalty. After that, start an Assetto Corsa session and open the in-game Real Penalty Settings app to arrange its interface elements on your screen as desired.

## Performance Optimization

With over 50 cars expected on the server, the hardware demands—especially on the CPU—will be significantly higher than usual. This grid size is well beyond what we normally run in Syndicate events, so unless your system is equipped with a high-end processor, you should expect to lower some Video and CSP settings to maintain smooth performance.

Below are several Content Manager settings that have proven effective in reducing CPU load. While these are primarily visual options, they also have a notable indirect impact on processor usage:

_CSP → Extra FX: Disable this option_: (Extra FX adds an additional rendering pass for visual enhancements and is very demanding on performance.)

_CSP → Graphic Adjustments_: Enable AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution. Using a slightly reduced quality value (around 77%) can significantly boost framerate—even on NVIDIA GPUs.

_CSP modules_: Consider turning off any non-essential CSP features to improve performance. However, always keep Weather FX, Car Instruments, Graphic Adjustments, and Lighting FX enabled.

_Assetto Corsa → Video settings_: Use a performance-focused preset. For example, lower the resolution of shadows, reflections, and mirrors, and reduce the World Detail level.

### Testing Your Setup

To confirm your configuration is sufficient, perform an offline test with you + 53 AI cars from the car packs at Mexico 1967 circuit. If you can complete this scenario without regular “CPU occupancy >99%” warnings (aside from large AI incidents) and maintain a stable framerate without slow-motion effects, your system should be able to handle the race comfortably.

If you experience slow-motion gameplay or frequent “CPU occupancy >99%” warnings during this test, further optimization is required. Should you be unable to resolve the issue on your own, please ask for assistance on the Syndicate Motorsport Discord Server.

## Circuit

![circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Autodromo_Hermanos_Rodriguez_1963.svg/1920px-Autodromo_Hermanos_Rodriguez_1963.svg.png)

The 1967 layout of Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is a fast, flowing circuit located in Mexico City. It is famous for its long straights, high-speed sweepers, and the daunting Peraltada, a heavily banked corner that tests courage and precision. Because of the high altitude (≈2,250 m), engines produce strong power, but aerodynamic grip is reduced, changing how corners feel.
